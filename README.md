This is a project challenge from FRONT END MENTOR for INTERMEDIATE. The purpose of this project is to polish my vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS skills.

## What I Learned

- The importance of focusing on harder projects.
- I am happy to know that I can easily finish this kind of website in a few hours.
- More about DOM manipulation.
- Some cool tricks.

## What I'm Proud Of

- Even when I had some problems that I didn't know the solution to, I had a framework of thinking in my mind that helped me easily Google the things I needed and incorporate them together to form a solution.

## Note for future

- make it responsive. (didn't do it now because I felt that I could acomplish it without improving my skills much)
